```json
{
  "type": "text|url|page|image",
  "content": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "source_url": "...",
  "text": "..." // for pages only
}
```

## Security

- No data is stored locally except for configuration
- All content is sent directly to your configured ZONEd server
- Optional API token support for authenticated instances
- Content scripts run in isolated context to prevent conflicts

## Development

To modify the extension:

1. Edit files in the `extension/` directory
2. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Test on various websites to ensure compatibility

### Key Files

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration and permissions
- `background.js` - Service worker for context menus and API calls
- `content.js` - Injected script for page interaction

## Compatibility

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Check your ZONEd server URL in settings
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the extension has access to the current tab
- **Content not saving**: Check browser console for API errors
- **CORS issues**: Your ZONEd server may need to allow extension origins
