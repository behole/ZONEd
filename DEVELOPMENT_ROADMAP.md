## üéØ **Current Session Progress**

### **Completed ‚úÖ**
- [x] Fixed server SIGTERM crashes
- [x] Added comprehensive error boundaries
- [x] Implemented SafeNumericDisplay for bulletproof numeric operations
- [x] Enhanced URL extraction with better error handling
- [x] Added dedicated iOS share endpoint
- [x] Comprehensive debugging and logging

### **In Progress üîÑ**
- [ ] AI Intelligence Improvements (Next Priority)
- [ ] iOS Sharing content extraction fix
- [ ] Database cleanup and optimization

### **Next Session Focus üéØ**
1. **AI Model Upgrade**: Switch to Claude/GPT-4 for better insights
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Remove templated responses, add genuine insights
3. **Database Cleanup**: Remove test data, keep valuable content
4. **Content Quality**: Improve extraction and processing

## üìù **Notes and Context**

### **Current Issues**
- AI responses are too templated (GPT-4o-mini limitation)
- iOS sharing sends placeholder text instead of actual content
- Database contains test/trash data mixed with valuable content
- Need more designer-specific AI insights

### **Success Metrics**
- AI responses should be conversational and insightful, not templated
- iOS sharing should work reliably (90%+ success rate)
- Database should contain only meaningful, well-processed content
- System should provide genuine creative insights for design work

### **Technical Context**
- Server: Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL on Railway
- Client: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- AI: OpenAI API (currently GPT-4o-mini, upgrading to GPT-4/Claude)
- Vector DB: Simple in-memory vector store with OpenAI embeddings
